BasicRender is a graphics library that makes it easy to display graphics on a console screen. Four libraries are included, and can all be downloaded over at the release page.

This project also includes a small demo program. After a neat little BasicWindow, it tells the very very tiny 8 line story of a man who insulted an AI for the last time. It includes exactly one landscape I drew in [henja](https://github.com/igtampe/Henja3) that came out ~~horrible~~ great.

In each project's folder you'll see a readme with a bit of documentation. Each method also has XML documentation so you don't have to have this markdown document open.
