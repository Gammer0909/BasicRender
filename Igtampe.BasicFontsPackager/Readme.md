## BasicFont Editor

![Sample](https://github.com/igtampe/BasicRender/blob/master/Images/BasicFonts/FontPackager.png?raw=true)

A Basic editor/packager for BasicFonts. Fonts can be created and saved, and each character can be individually edited in the bundled/dependency copy of Henja3. BasicFonts interprets White on Henja3 as transparent, and Black as colorable pixels when transforming DF data into BasicFont Character Data. While currently untested, putting any other colors should be preserved when transforming/writing the text.

The editor also brings up a Console Window, which is used to preview text when hitting the "Preview" menustrip item. I should probably make it look a little nicer though... Maybe someday.

The editor is meant to be an end product, and does not have anything aside from its forms. I dont think anything of use can be found here.
